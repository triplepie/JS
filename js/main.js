var hi = "hello";//this is a variable

//float, String, Interger, Boolean, Array, and object
var hello = ["hi","how","Are", "You", "Doing", "?"];//this is an array

// some of the logical operators are == equal, > greater then, < less then, =! not equal to, <= less then or equal to, >= greater then or equal to etc.
//another thing that you could do is functions which makes a new function to use;

var number1 = (5);
var number2 = (20);

var x = myFunction(4, 3);        // Function is called, return value will end up in x

function myFunction(a, b) {
     alert(a * b);                // Function returns the product of a and b
}
var x = prompt("What is your first numer");
var y = prompt("what is your second number");
alert(x * y); //asked for users number then made a calculator

var a = prompt("What is your first number for division");
var b = prompt("What is your second number for division");
alert(a/b);  //made a division calculator

var c = prompt("How are you doing")
alert("good")
